# Utilizing state machines in front-end development

A presentation about state machines, statecharts and XState made with [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com). The [PDF export](utilizing-state-machines-in-front-end-development.pdf) found in the repository includes pretty comprehensive speaker notes, so it should be possible to get the main idea of the presentation just by skimming through the PDF.
